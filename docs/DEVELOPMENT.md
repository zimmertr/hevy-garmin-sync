# Development

CI is the test runner. Branch from the latest `main`, open a draft PR early, push small commits, and read the jobs ([CICD.md](CICD.md)). Run something locally only when CI can't answer the question, and then in Docker: every target below runs in a container, and nothing installs on the workstation.

## Make targets

| Target | Runs |
|---|---|
| `make test` | The suite under coverage, as the `test` job does |
| `make test-one MODULE=tests.test_cli` | One module, verbose |
| `make lint` | ruff |
| `make typecheck` | mypy, strict |
| `make lint-docker` | hadolint on the Dockerfile |
| `make chart` | `helm lint` and two renders, as the `Chart` job does |
| `make build` | The image, tagged `hevy-garmin-sync:dev` |
| `make scan` | The release scan's rules against that build |
| `make lock` | Not a check: recompiles `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` from the `.in` files, hashed. A pin change ships with its lock in the same PR |

## Tests

- Every change ships with tests. Coverage aims at 100% of lines and branches, CI reports it, and a gap gets a test or a written reason. A test asserts on behaviour; one that only runs a line is deleted.
- `unittest` and `unittest.mock`. No test touches the network or a real account.
- Fakes come from one fixtures module that #1 adds: recorded Hevy and Garmin responses with every name, id, token and email replaced (spec D-10). A fake can fail the way the real service fails.
- Time is fixed: tests pin the clock and the time zone, and no test spells a calendar date.
- A test that reads files fails when it can't find them, instead of skipping.
